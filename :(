Below are some poems I found that try and explain what I felt 

1)
There is no magic any more,
We meet as other people do,
You work no miracle for me
Nor I for you.
-Sara Teasdale

2)
When I hit the rock bottom
that exists after the rock bottom
and no rope or hand appeared
I wondered
what if nothing wants me
because i dont want me
perhaps I am both the poison
and the antidote
-Rupi Kaur

3)
This was once a love poem,
before its haunches thickened, its breath grew short,
before it found itself sitting,
perplexed and a little embarrassed,
on the fender of a parked car,
while many people passed by without turning their heads.
-Jane Hirshfield
