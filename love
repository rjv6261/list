Below is a list of poems by a bunch of random people that I like

1)
I wish I could remember that first day,
First hour, first moment of your meeting me,
If bright or dim the season, it might be
Summer or Winter for aught I can say;
So unrecorded did it slip away,
So blind was I to see and to foresee,
So dull to mark the budding of my tree
That would not blossom yet for many a May.
If only I could recollect it, such
A day of days! I let it come and go
As traceless as a thaw of bygone snow;
It seemed to mean so little, meant so much;
If only now I could recall that touch,
First touch of hand in hand – Did one but know!
-Christina Rossetti

2)
She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that’s best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes
- Lord Byron (mfer was an actual lord)

3)
Have you ever met someone you think about
every night and every day,
someone so beautiful it's breathtaking
and words just aren't enough to say?
Have you ever met someone so special
you can't imagine life without,
someone you want to talk forever
and learn everything about?
Have you ever met someone just as crazy
who wanted to have just as much fun,
someone you can dance all night with
and together watch the rising sun?
Have you ever met someone so amazing
you wish you could pause the time so it doesn't end?
This someone is you,
and I'd like you to be my girlfriend.
-Jason J. Beaton.

4)
I never really knew you.
You were just another friend,
But when I got to know you,
I let my heart unbend.
-Dave Lawrie

5)
True love is a durable fire,
In the mind ever burning,
Never sick, never dead, never cold,
From itself never turning.
-William Shakespeare
